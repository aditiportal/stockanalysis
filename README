A JAVA program to analyze previous stock market data to help predict market reversals based on the Harami Pattern

This program contains five classes:
Main.java contains the main method that runs the program.
Stock.java class stores the stock's daily data and the associated methods to access it.
StockData.java class containts the specific day data (open, close, high, low) for the stock.
StockWeekData.java class contains the specific week data (open, close, high, low) for the stock.
StockPattern.java class utilizes the least squares linear regression and Harami algorithm to determine a reversal.

The input required is the name of the stock and the CSV file. The CSV file for the stock can be downloaded from the stock history tab on Yahoo Finance.

Usage:
java Main <Stock Symbol> <Stock Historical Data CSV file> 

In the future I plan to expand my program to utilize other candlestick patterns in conjuction with the Harami pattern.
